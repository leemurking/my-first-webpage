<h1>Adopt My Pet</h1>
<p>I own a cute 2-year-old Greman Shepherd. It has a nice thick black and white coat of fur that hardly sheds making it condusive to keep around the house.</p>
<p> The dog is well trained and responds to commands such as:
    <ul>
        <li>Come</li>
        <li>Stay</li>
        <li>Fetch</li>
        <li>Attack</li>
    </ul>
Among many other commands</p>
<p>The dog's name is Vex and it loves chew toys. It also loves balls and rubber toys.</p>
<p>Vex is a very active dog that enjoys running and exercise. It can be taken on runs and serve as a guard dog, as well as an exercise companion.</p>
<p>Other than running Ves enjoys:
    <ul>
        <li>Swimming</li>
        <li>Long walks</li>
        <li>Playing with Chilren</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>Vex is a very good dog and i'm looking to find him a fun and loving home.</p>
